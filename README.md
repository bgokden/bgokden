# Berk Gökden

**Software Engineer | ML/AI, Data Engineering & Distributed Systems Specialist**

I'm an experienced engineer passionate about building high-performance systems, designing data architectures, and solving complex technical challenges. I love the entire spectrum of software engineering—from low-level systems programming to architecting scalable data platforms and creating intelligent agent systems.

## What I Do

I specialize in building production-grade systems at the intersection of **machine learning**, **data engineering**, and **distributed computing**. My work spans:

- **Data Engineering & Architecture**: Designing scalable data platforms, data lakes, data warehouses, ETL/ELT pipelines, and real-time streaming architectures
- **AI/ML Infrastructure**: Feature stores, recommender systems, LLM tooling, and scalable ML pipelines
- **Agent Systems**: Designing and building autonomous agents, multi-agent architectures, and intelligent automation
- **Distributed Systems**: High-performance data processing, cloud-native architectures, and microservices
- **Systems Programming**: Performance-critical applications in Go and C++

## Featured Projects

### [veri](https://github.com/bgokden/veri) ⭐ 54
A **scalable feature store** built in Go for machine learning applications. Supports KNN search and efficient feature serving for ML models in production.

### [llama-constrain](https://github.com/bgokden/llama-constrain)
A **constrained generation library** for llama.cpp that prevents malformed outputs. Enables structured output generation (XML, JSON) from LLMs with guaranteed correctness.

### [miniagent](https://github.com/bgokden/miniagent)
A lightweight **AI agent framework** designed to work with minimal resources. Built in Go for efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments.

### [lstm-recommender-example](https://github.com/bgokden/lstm-recommender-example)
A **recommender system** using Keras LSTM that treats product purchases as time-series data. Demonstrates practical deep learning applications in e-commerce.

### [go-encrypt](https://github.com/bgokden/go-encrypt)
Encryption and hash library for Go, providing secure cryptographic primitives for distributed applications.
